# resource-based uncertainty of software platforms using Dynamic Software Production line (DSPL)
The development of uncertainty-aware dynamic platforms includes the following:
- Extending the available feature model in dynamic software production line by assigning uncertainty as a quality attribute.
- Assigning confidence coefficient to model elements in dynamic software production line feature model.
- Weighted probability uncertainty propagation in the extended DSPL feature model.
- Uncertainty-aware feature ranking for product configuration using ABS language in a feature model.
The features used to configure the final product were selected by running ABS using feature ranking.
